# HTML5 + Node starter project
My go-to project setup for framework-free development using modern build tools.

## Features:
 - Node connect, for static site serving
 - Babel, for ES6 Javascript
 - Rollup, for ES6 Modules support
 - SCSS, for snazzy CSS development
 - PostCSS, for things like prefix-free CSS development via Autoprefixer
 - Watch, to save some reloads
